operator in javascript

    let x = 30              '=' is assignment operator
    let y = 30 + 40         '+' addition operator
    let z = 60 - 40         '-' subtraction operator
    let a = 60 * 40         '*' multiplication operator
    let b = 60 / 40         '/' division operator
    let c = 60 % 40       '%' Modulus operator give remainder    ex 20 will be output
    let d = 60**2           '**' power/exponential operator  ex- 60*60

    increment operator
    a=10
    a++;            i.e. a=a+1;

    decrement operator
    m=20;
    m--;            i.e. m=m-1;

    increment and decrement operatoronly used with 'var' and 'let' but not with const keyword.
    ex-
     var a=10;a++;
     let b=50;b--;
     const c=50;c--;        it will produce error

    increment and decremet operatornot work with const keyword or constant values .it will produce error.
     
     const c=20;
     c++;   
     c--;           const c is constant so value of c is also constant.SO IT will producw error;


     var x=20++;
     let y=21++;

      both will produce error this cant be writen like this as 20 is constant in yhis

    Assignment operator
    "=";
        var a;
        a=20;    in this 20 is assigned to a;

        '+='    a+=20         a=a+20
        '-='    a-=20         a=a-20
        '*='    a*=20         a=a*20  
        '/='    a/=20         a=a/20  
        '**='   a**=20        a=a**20  
        '%='    a%=20         a=a%20




        x=3 y=5
    1.  x+=y
        x=x+y
        x=3+5
        x=8
    
    2.  x**=y
        x=x**y
        x=3**5
        x=243
    
    3.  x-=y+20
        x=x-(y+20)
        x=-22
    
    4.  x=y++       in post increment firstly value assignd to x then it will increment
        x=5
    
    5.  x=++y       in pre increment first value will be increment then it will assigned to the x
        x=6
        

    6.  x%=(y+3)
        x=x%8
        x=3%8
        x=3



Pre increment= a=++b;
Post increment= a=b++
pre Decrement= x=--y
Post decrement= x=y--


var a=30,b=3;
c=a++ + b++;
console.log(c);
console.log(a);
console.log(b);


        Comparision operator

a==b  equality check
        it will produce true if value of a is equal to value of b otherwise it will produce false

a===b strict equlity check
        it will prodiuce true if value of a and b as well as type of a and b both are same then it is strict equality check
<   less than
>   greater than
<=  less than equal to
>=  grerater than equal to
!= not equal to
!== not equal to value as well as type

2=="2"
true
2==="2"
false



    ternary operator

    condition?exp1:exp2
        if the conditionis true then exp1 is the output else conditionis falsethen output will exp2

    var a=true?5:3

    output 5

    var a=30<=30?5:6
    output 5



        concatenation operator
        "+" symbol used for concatenation

        it is used only with at least one string
        if it is used with number then it should be done like addition

        example-   2+4+65=71
                    2+"5"+65= 2565
                    2+"alpha"+85=2alpha85

Logical operator

    &&  (Logical and)

        a           b           output
        true        true        true
        true        false       false
        false       true        false
        false       false       false       

            in logical and (&&) if any condition is false then output produced by this result in false



            var a=3,b=6;
            d=(a++>=3 && b-- <=6)
                true        true

                a=4
                b=5
                d= true


    ||  (logical or)
                        a           b           output
        				true        true        true
   				        true        false       true
       				    false       true        true
        				false       false       false       
	
	  in logical or (||) if any condition is true then output produced by this result in true





    !   (logical not)

        !true  = false
        !false = true


        var a= true
        var b=!a

        console.log(b);     false

inlogical and &&

        var a= 3,b=6
        var d= a++ >= b-- && b++ <= a--
                3 >= 6    && 5<=4
                  false  &&          (here first condition is false so the second condition will not evaluated because in and operator
                                                    if one conditionis false the output is false)

               so value are false
                a=4
                b=5   because nextcondition will not run


    In logical or  (||)

var a= 6,b=3
        var d= a++ >= b-- || b++ >= a--
                6 >= 3    || 2>=7
  true      ||                    (here first condition is true so the second condition will not evaluated because in or operator if one conditionis true the output is true)

               so value are true
                a=7
                b=2   because next condition will not run

Relational operator         LOGICAL operator
    <=                          &&
    >=                          ||  
    ==                           !






    b=6
    a=2
    false
