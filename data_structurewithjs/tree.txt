it is a non linear data structure
searching very fast
it has parent node ,children node

a----->b
a----->c
 here  a is the parent node b and c are children node
leaf nodes-  a node having no children

inorder traversal-->left node right

Post order traversal --> left right node

pre order traversal -->node left right 

pre-2,8,7,6,13,9,6,15,8
in- 6,7,8,13,2,6,9,8,15
post-6,7,13,8,6,8,15,9,2



balanced and unbalanced tree
